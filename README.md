# Getting Started with WebBars+

## Develop Node version is 16.14.2.
## Other Node versions are not tested.

## `npm i`
If you don't have dependecies installed yet, you should use `npm i` to install dependencies in the application folder.

## `npm run dev`
After you install dependencies, in the application folder, you can use `npm run dev` to run as an electron app. Altough you can use `npm start` to start the front-end in the browser, the back-end would not work in such case.
